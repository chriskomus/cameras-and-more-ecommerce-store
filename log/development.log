The problem was that they were nowhere to be found. The two friends decided to take matters into their own hands and created their own signature sauce recipe to satisfy their craving. Jim and Scott’s signature wings began drumming up great demand and the pair opened up their first restaurant, “Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck” near the campus of The Ohio State University.

The restaurant was a hit with college students and has since developed a fanatical following across the country. Expanding the Brand The concept quickly proved to be both well-loved by its guests and profitable for its founders, so they began to expand. Through a variety of franchise agreements, Disbrow and Lowery opened a number of Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants at a rapid pace at locations primarily on or near Midwest college campuses. Buffalo Wild Wings’ focus on great wings, a wide variety of beer and plenty of sports on dozens of TVs resonated strongly with college students, and as these students graduated and moved on, so did the demand for the concept. Over the years, these alumni continue to return to their local Buffalo Wild Wings with their friends and families. Sally Smith Takes the Helm While the concept was able to grow to 35 locations in its first 12 years, the founders eventually encountered challenges faced by many entrepreneurs as they expand. In 1994, Sally Smith came on board as CFO and put in place the infrastructure needed to establish the Accounting, Human Resources, Finance and Marketing departments. In 1996, Smith was named CEO and began to tackle the more challenging task of broadening the appeal of the chain by revising the name, redesigning the buildings and evolving from a college bar to a sports bar and grill that would attract a wider audience."}, "commit"=>"Create Static page"}
